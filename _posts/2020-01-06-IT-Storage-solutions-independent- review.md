<h1>IT Storage solutions independent review.</h1>
Storage systems tend to be the top most expensive kit in the modern datacentre, sometimes they are being the only single point of failure in the datacentre, and many times function as the main bottleneck in the IT organization ability to scale and respond to an Ad-Hoc demand.


Hydro IT was founded by Gidi Marcus, a storage specialist with 8 years of in-depth experience deploying and maintaining storage and Microsoft products at growing enterprises in London.
Among other vendors we specialize in the NetApp portfolio, IBM, Pure Storage and Dell Compellent. Having the exposure to that many vendors and technologies and implementations, allows us to recommend you the right solution for the task, understand the sizing and cost models, point at the differences and compare between them - from the eyes of the customer.


<h2>Isn’t all vendor just the same?</h2>
<b>In theory – yes,</b> they all use similar commodity base hardware and provide the same set of front-end protocols. They also all claim to have top of the class developer kit, security, efficiencies technology and the integration with dozens of other products. 


<b>In practice – we’re afraid not.</b>
<ul>
<li> Vendors do use different grade of hardware, some even not publishing their actual specs – but just IOPS capacity based on unrealistic benchmarks. </li>
<li> Some behave very differently on different workload based on their backend processing (dedup, encryption, compression) and on edge-cases such as when they almost full, or when the data changes certain patterns. </li>
<li> Some developer kits and migration tools are lacking – they are performing badly, offload error-handling to the developer, badly documented and sometimes frequently change while having badly implement backward capability. </li>
<li> While they all tend to be, some are just too much of a “black box”, requiring each operation to be done by the vendor which increases the risks, limit the maintenance window flexibility, and lock the organization to not being able to do ANY operation without a valid support contract.</li>
<li> Some are not mature, too mature or just having other common use (e.g. if the vendor support 4 protocols but only one is mostly used and tested across their install-base). </li>
<li> They use very different sizing and pricing methodologies, sometimes over-spec or under-spec a solution to get to a target price. And many times, using practices to lock organization down as part of the deal .</li> 
</ul>

You may notice that from that list – many of the variable’s ire incomparable, not easy to spot during a POC or negotiation, and not publicly documented or talked about.
Therefore, it’s important to have the opinion of someone that extensively used the product – in a similar organization and environment as yours. And have seen different quotes from the competitors to evaluate the potential cost saving that can be gained with the right negotiation tactics. 

<h2>Our storage product evaluation service</h2>
The service we offer varies from a fast and straight-forward evaluation of the offer in hand. To the option of running of a full POC on your premises and your workload together with the vendors, evaluate the results and assist with the negotiation, final sizing and deployment of the chosen solution.
